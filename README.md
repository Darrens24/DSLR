# DSLR Project Overview

## Introduction
The DSLR (Data Science & Logistic Regression) project at 42 is designed to introduce students to the fundamental concepts of data science and logistic regression. Using Python, this project explores data manipulation, analysis, and predictive modeling with a particular emphasis on logistic regression. Throughout this project, the primary dataset revolves around the Harry Potter universe, providing a unique and engaging context for applying data science techniques. Everything is implemented from scratch, allowing us to understand the main concepts in depth.
Our program obtained 99% accuracy with the correction tests.

## Objectives
- **Data Exploration:** Utilize libraries such as pandas and numpy to clean and explore the dataset.
- **Visualization:** Implement matplotlib for data visualization, facilitating an understanding of data distributions and relationships.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Apply logistic regression using scikit-learn to predict a target variable based on several predictor variables.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assess the model's performance and improve accuracy through various techniques.

## Bonus Achievements
In addition to the core objectives, this project includes several bonus challenges that were met:
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Improved model accuracy by fine-tuning the logistic regression model's hyperparameters.
- **Advanced Data Preprocessing:** Employed advanced techniques for data cleaning and feature engineering to enhance model performance.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Conducted a comparative study of different models to determine the most effective approach for our dataset.
- **User Interface Implementation:** Developed a user-friendly interface to interact with the predictive model, allowing for easy data input and interpretation of predictions.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib

## Challenges Faced
- **Data Cleaning:** The initial challenge was to clean and preprocess the dataset effectively, ensuring it was suitable for analysis and modeling.
- **Model Selection:** Determining the most appropriate model and adjusting its parameters for optimal performance required extensive testing and evaluation.
- **Interpretation of Results:** Understanding and conveying the implications of the model's predictions was crucial for demonstrating the project's success.

## Outcomes
The project successfully demonstrated the ability to apply data science techniques to a real-world dataset, resulting in a predictive model with improved accuracy through the implementation of bonus achievements. The comparative analysis and user interface further enriched the project, showcasing the practical application of data science concepts.
